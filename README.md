# ECSE321 - Group 6 #

# Scope of the project #

The goal of this project is to build a system via website and mobile Android application for a library of a small town. This system will allow customers to create an account online using an email address or in person with the help of a librarian. With an account, the system will allow the users to browse available titles online such as books, movies, music albums, newspapers and archieves, some of which can be picked up afterwards in the physical location with a reservation. The system will also allow users to book an event at the library for the members of the community. The librarians also take care of checking out the items in the library. Finally, a head-librarian who is assisted by several librarians manages the library and has all the privileges of a librarian in addition to a couple more, such as deciding the opening hours/days of the library and assigning the librarians their schedules.
